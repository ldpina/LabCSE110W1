### Introduction
**As a person**:Hi! I am a third year Cogsci major. A little bit about my self is that I would say I am a very dedicated person to anything that peaks my interest. I really like to find ways to travel to different parts of the world for *cheap*! Im also a workaholic cause I gotta fun these cheap trips somehow :D.

**As a programmer**: I would often say I keep my code clean and like to make sure it is easily readable. However my memory is very wonky when it comes to remembering the usage and purposes of commands in data strucutres.  *** BUT once I do remember them I would say most things come easily to me ***

### Fav Quote:
My favorite quote is:
> "if you are not making mistakes, you are not learning"

### Useful Code
Just in case you need a function in python to check if a number is even or odd:

```
def even (n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return "even"
    else:
        return "odd"
```

Now for a commerical break. This site was brought to you by, [GitHub Pages](https://page.github.com/)/. Now back to your regularly scheduled program.

### The usage of relative links
To learn about my favorite coding language for coding interviews check my [README.md](LABCSE110W1/README.md) :D

To prepare for these interviews you want to learn the following:
1. Find a coding language you are most comfortable with!
2. Learn the UMPIRE METHOD!
3. Review all basic data strucutres
4. Remeber it is okay not to solve the coding challenge in the allotted time! Interviewers mainly wanna see your thought process!

Now you can check off a task off your todolist for the today! Didn't make one? Here is one I made for you :D
[x] Recieve unsolicited coding interview advice 
[ ] Call your parents
[x] Clean your living space (assuming you cleaned alredy)
[ ] Cook
[ ] Listen to Jcole's new album
